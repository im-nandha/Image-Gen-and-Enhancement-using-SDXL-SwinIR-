## Overview

- **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL):** Generates images from text prompts.
- **SwinIR:** Enhances the quality of generated images through image restoration and super-resolution.

The pipeline first generates an image from text with SDXL, then uses SwinIR to enhance image resolution and details.
